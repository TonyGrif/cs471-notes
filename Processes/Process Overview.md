# Process Overview
A process represents a unit of resource allocation, in that it is a program in execution. Processes do not, by default, share [[Main Memory Overview | memory]] and have the ability to create [[Fork & Termination| child processes]] or [[Threads| threads]]. Each process has its own unique process identification number (PID) even if they are executing the same program.
