# Logical Address Space
Logical address space is generated by the CPU and also referred to as virtual addresses. Both logical and [[Physical Address Space | physical addresses]] are the same at compile and load time binding schemes, but differ in execution-time. A logical address space is the set of logical addresses generated by a program. These address must be bound by the [[Memory-Management Unit | MMU]] before usage.
## Base and Limit Registers
A base and limit define the bounds of a logical address space. The **base** specifies the starting point, while the **limit** defines the length of the space. Every memory access generated in user mode is checked by the CPU to ensure it is operating in proper memory. If outsides these bounds, a **fatal error** is flagged.
