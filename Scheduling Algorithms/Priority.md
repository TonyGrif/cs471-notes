# Priority
This algorithms uses a priority value to determine which [[Process Overview | process]] should go next. The higher priority is the one with the smallest integer. This can be preemptive or non-preemptive. 
## Aging
This algorithm can lead to a process being starved out. The solution to this is **aging**. That is when the priority of a process increases as time progresses.
