# Directories
Directories are symbol tables that translate [[Files | file]] names into directory entries.
## Single-Level
This is the simplest structure where all files are contained in the same directory.
## Two-Level
The two-level directory structure creates a separate directory for each user.
## Tree Structured
This is a generalized version of the [[#Two-Level | two-level structure]] for an arbitrary height. A directory is simply another [[Files | file]] but treated in a special way. Each directory contains a set of files or sub-directories.
