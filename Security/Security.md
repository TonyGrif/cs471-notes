# Cryptography
This method of [[#Security | security]] ensures secure communication over insecure medium. The idea is to encode a message so that the receiver is the only entity that can decode and read it.
## Symmetric
Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for the encryption and decryption.
## Asymmetric
Asymmetric cryptography uses a different key for encryption and decoding. It is important to note that the keys cannot be derived from each other; this allows the encryption key to be made publicly available.
### Digital-Signature Algorithm
This produces authentication (digital signatures) that are used for the receiver to verify that the message came from a trusted source and has not been modified in transit.
