# Distributed Systems
A distributed system is a collection of loosely coupled processors (**nodes**) connected by a communication network. This setup has the benefits of:
1. Resource Sharing.
2. Computation Speedup.
3. Reliability.
4. Communication.
5. Cost Reduction.
## Robustness
Distributed systems offer:
1. Failure Detection: detecting when a node fails.
2. Reconfiguration: finding a new path when a node goes down.
## Distributed File System
A distributed [[File Systems | file system]] allows multiple users to share files and [[Storage Overview | storage]] resources. This requires a service, server, and client(s).
